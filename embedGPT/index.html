                            onout.org founder.
                        </address> From the creator: Last year, I monitored various use cases of the ChatGPT API among others, and the most popular by far was a simple chat that can be placed on one's website. It looks something like this.
<br>
<img src="https://sensorica.onout.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image_2024-01-26_16-45-08-1.png"  alt="ChatGPT on website" class="w-100">

<br><br>
At the same time, there are also more complex use cases possible. For example, based on a company's internal instructions, one can create many small assistants that would help employees with their work, like writing letters or training staff (after uploading product descriptions). One such case was a dashboard for a chemical product sales company with a staff of 300 people. Thanks to embeddable ChatGPT, this dashboard contains dozens of separate chats, each configured for a specific business process.
<br><br>
Another interesting case is increasing the time users spend on a page. After placing an AI assistant on a page with a technical article for developers and inviting them to ask questions as they would at the end of a lecture, the average time spent increased by one and a half times.
<br><br>
There are many cases in general. The simplest way to integrate ChatGPT on a website is to use our tool.
<br><br>
However, we have also gathered a few other services that might help you, in the form of a JSON file with prices and features. Here is a brief summary.
<br><br>
Unlike them, our tool doesn't have fancy features, but it does offer great flexibility. One of the support requests was about how to sell access to the chat, like OpenAI does. 

                     After detailed analysis of 15 sites (founded in google with keyword "embed chatgpt") and review of 120 features we picked few servicies who offer embedable chatgpt for websites. The product features list have been optimized, removing redundant, overly specific, marketing fluff, and ambiguous content. This effort has resulted in a refined list, presenting a clearer, more informative overview that is broadly applicable and relevant across various implementations. </p>
