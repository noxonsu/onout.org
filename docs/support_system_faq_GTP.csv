Product name,Question,Answer
farm,q: i mean i see on you frontend it indicate how much reward tokens are in farm contract, can that be remove from the frontend a: Yes, its can be removed
launchpad,q: i mean can the marketplace be ready soon like tomorrow or ? a: the marketplace will not work with you blockchain. it uses the ripple api, and only works with the networks it supports We can develop a separate application that will use not the Ripple API, but a separate contract Development cost - 500$ Lead time - one week
unifactory,q: So I can use Uniswap Base factory and router for LP in Unifactory? a: Unifactory cannot use any external contract other than one's own. You need your personal contracts for each network. If you don't have one on Ethereum, you have to deploy it first from the admin panel. If you don't have it for Base, you have to deploy it on Base first and then you can use it.
launchpad,q: If we buy IDO factory, we need to Infura.io Ipfs for setting? A: yes you need infura-ipfs.io and RPC node with wss for example p2pify.com
general,q: Not possible to link activation key with new address? a: have you lost your last address? it's not possible to link activation key to new address
general,q: When trying to connect with old wallet I have access denied q: Domain linked to your current wallet as owner
unifactory,q: Can I use Unifactory and Farm for optimism network? a: You can't do it right now. We can integrate this network in both products. Current integration prices are here: https://support.onout.org/hc/1331700057/32/addnewnetwork?category_id=8 q: Can I run Unifactory and Farm on same WordPress install? a: Let me clarify this info from devs q: Any deal of we buy 2 plugins? a: Not at the moment q: Are you available for custom work? How much would it cost if we wanted to update the design on the farming. a: Yes, but it depends on amount and type of work. The longer the job takes the less likely we are to take it on.
unifactory,q: Can I run Unifactory and Farm on same WordPress install? a: It's not possible to lounch it at the same time. Working and reliable solution is to lounch each app on your own subdomain. For example your site site.com and you louch it under farm.site.com and dex.farm.com. There can be some kind of Multi Plugin plugins, but you need to be careful and keep in mind the security of third-party plugins if you want to use it.
unifactory,q: In Unifactory if we set the factory and router from the Uniswap V2 will it work? Or we need own router and factory? a: It's not possible. You need to deploy your personal contracts. q: In Unifactory is it possible to use push-button connection rather than forced automatic connection? a: Not right not, but we can make it.
unifactory,q: Is Unifactory this white label? a: Please, clarify what you mean by white label. q: Is Unifactory has any ongoing support or updates? a: Yes. If problems arise, we'll fix them. For any individual work (for example, you want some changes for yourself personally), we do it for a separate fee. And it should be understood we have many clients, so the solution sometimes may not be so fast. q: Can you tell me a final price with Optimism integration? a: It's $1200. $1000 for the application + $200 for network integration. Also you can see active integration prices here: https://support.onout.org/hc/1331700057/32/addnewnetwork?category_id=8 q: Can we use any external liquidity in Unifactory? a: Not possible, because liquidity are located inside the contracts. So you have to deploy you own contracts. There's also an option for long and serious recycling so you can use third-party liquidity right away. But in this case you will only use the interface. There will be no possibility to add your commission (contracts are someone else's). q: How secure is MCW which displays private keys in a browser? a: It's only as safe as your system is safe (OS, browser, extensions). By default we don't send any private info outside of the application. And we use in-app crypto libraries to generate wallet related data (all happens inside your browser). q: Is it possible integrate safe.global in the MCW? a: I cannot tell you right now. It takes our sources to learn that service and make a decision.
general,q: hi! is everething okey with ETH network? We are going to improove UX for clarify how to deploy dex to network another than BSC. Q: I am deploying the exchange to a network other than BSC, but the app is requesting a switch to BSC. Why is that? A: We are utilizing the BSC network as a database since the app does not have a backend database. After deploying the contracts, it is necessary to save the new settings to storage, which is why you need to use both networks.
general,q: I mean the ido factory adress and the token locker factory adress. a: just put erc20 to fee token (in future at this week you can you this) - and click deploy - after save deployed contracts to storage
general,q: But i can't deploy your contracts directly because they are giving errors and warnings in remix a: So it’s logical - you weren’t able to put together a contract from the source, in a remix - is that the problem?
general,q: here are the updated versions, i updated. a: at this week will be update with Contract section at flat source of contracts q: so should i just wait for the update so i can deploy on remix myself? Think that's the quickest way to go? a: Yes - in folder with contracts will be flatten versions, with you can withou promble compile in remix
general,q: what chain is used to exchange polygon tokens on the product a: used polygon blockchain - chainid 137(0x89) q: in other words will my gas be massive if this is done on ETH a: if you use polygon - you pay native polygon coins - MATIC q: doesnt work: https://screenshots.wpmix.net/chrome_flURjFcp6AeS8A6TVaePogI32uV61jPT.png a: - its image in banner in our MCW procuct - you can manage baners items via admin panel q: Does this comment mean all polygon/MATIC tokens a: Its means token via ERC20 standart deployed on polygon network q: Also I found this doesnt have polygon contracts that work a: its a demo - we are not deploy contracts for polygon only testnet network of bnb and eth - admin can deploy contracts for each network in list, and be owner, and recive fee from txs of swaps q: o smaller payments count toward the overall total t o buy the product a: no, the price includes developers’ time for support and adaptation of the product to your needs q: can it be cheaper? a: no - see answer above. you can find our products from scammers and buy them cheaper, but you will not have support - you will be alone with yourself and with the scammer Any other questions?
general,q: it support MetaMask and Trust Wallet in a mobile environment? What other wallets are supported? a: Yes, support, also support WalletConnect v2 (Last version on https://dash.onout.org/) q: Is it possible to fix the APY a: No, but we are can develop an application for your specific tasks
