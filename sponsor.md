We have 3 ways how you can sponsor development:

## 1.  Small fature sponsorship: 
If you are a buyer of a product and want to add an improvement. Improvement costs is calculated by a developer. To request a feature, please email support@onout.org or https://t.me/onoutsupportbot/?start=feature_sponsor. Describe your needs (what to be done) then a developer will answer you price and estimate time to arrival (ETA). We do not do customization, we only work to features that will be in demand by other users. If you request a small issue you have no return on your investmens besides done feature. If developer can't calculate a budget and ETA probably you request a big feature which requered to code a new module. 

## 2. New product or module (extention) sponsorship:
By default we copy original sources and deliver demo the same as on original aap. But if you want some changes or new functions you can request a fetaure and sponsor it. We pack this improvements to "module" (kind of "extention) and publish as separate product to aour catalogue. This means if someone else want's the same feature he just will buy a module you have sponsored and you will eant a dividends. For example: You credit us for X$ and we pay you back X$*1.5, but from future profit of this product or module (for example, 10% of revenue will be used to repay). 
And of course, you will get a forever license, primary support, installation service etc. 

### 2.1: To sponsor new peoduct or  send payment in two steps: 
#### 2.2.1. Research: 200$ jsut for research of avalibility to deliever your a solution and PRICE and estimate time arrival of the product or module
#### 2.2.1. Development PRICE

After success development we publish new product to dash.onout.org and smartcontract which process sales will automaticcaly forwards part of every payment to your address. 

Use case: After research we decided to create a DAO tool, development costs is $4000 and 2 months. The tool was released in the beginning of 2022. The product becomes profitable in 3 months.  (Revenue: Jan $1400, Feb $1670, March $2000). If you were a sponsor, you would get 170 bucks every month or 50%APY. Sales of another product MCW only grows for almost 2 years, that's mean real APY would be higher. But there are also risks of small sales or of delay. 


Q: How to start? <Br>
A: At first check our "presale" tab on dash.onout.org. If you know which project to fork collect this information:

- example links.
- is this project is opensource?
- source code license type. The best license types are MIT or GNU.

Please contact us and send this info to support@onout.org or [Telegram](https://t.me/onoutsupportbot/?start=feature_sponsor)

## 3. Buying new product on presale
In case when we have ETA of new product, we're added it to the dash.onnout.org, and you can find it in the "presale" tab. Presale price is always lower than after release.
