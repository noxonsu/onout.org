  <h2>What is KYC and Why is it Important?</h2>

  <p>KYC or Know Your Customer refers to the due diligence process of verifying the
  identity of clients and customers. It is a key prerequisite in today's digital economy
  to facilitate trust and security. For more on developing effective KYC software, you can refer to this <a href="https://onout.org/KYC/developer.html">article</a>.</p>

  <p>Some key reasons why KYC is important include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Preventing financial fraud and money laundering activities</li>
    <li>Adhering to anti-terrorism and anti-corruption regulations</li>
    <li>Verifying customer details and risk profile</li>
    <li>Building trust between business and customers</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For blockchain and Web3 projects looking for privacy-preserving alternatives to traditional KYC, consider <a href="https://onout.org/KYC/WorldID-integration.html">World ID integration</a> as a "Proof of Personhood" solution that combats bots while maintaining user privacy.</p>

  <h2>Understanding KYC APIs</h2>

  <p>KYC APIs or Application Programming Interfaces act as the gateway to integrate KYC
  processes directly into digital platforms and applications. They link to extensive
  databases of information to validate user identities in real-time. Dive deeper into the considerations for building such systems in this <a href="https://onout.org/KYC/developer.html">guide</a>.</p>


  <h3>How Do KYC APIs Work?</h3>

  <p>When a new user signs up, the KYC API pulls their personal information like name,
  date of birth, address etc. It cross-references this data across various verification
  databases to authenticate the user's identity. APIs may connect to data sources
  like:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Government ID databases</li>

    <li>Credit bureaus</li>

    <li>Sanctions lists</li>

    <li>Biometric databases</li>

    <li>Business registries</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Types of KYC APIs</h3>

  <p>Some common types of KYC APIs include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>KYC AML API</b> - For anti-money laundering checks</li>

    <li><b>eKYC API</b> - For electronic and digital KYC processes</li>

    <li><b>Video KYC API</b> - Uses liveness detection and video analysis</li>

    <li><b>Sanctions List API</b> - Screens users against sanctions databases</li>
  </ul>
